  <h1>2020: My goals for the year and decade.</h1>

  <p>
    Fun fact about me! I’ve never actually created New Year’s Resolutions; I guess I thought it was stupid because I always heard about people failing them and giving up in the first week. I know now that this was probably due to lack of goal-setting
    skills and just a general lack of knowledge about habits, motivation, and success. Understanding that success is not the end goal, but rather is simply persistent effort towards improving towards that goal is one of the most valuable things I
    have learned this past year and has allowed me to shape my life for the better. It is the driving factor for my resolutions this year.
  </p>

  <h2>My three main goals for 2020.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a job in Web development by 2020 by continuing to grow my skill set.</li>
    <li>Read a book a week.</li>
    <li>I want to be happy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of the toughest things for me to overcome recently has been the feeling of falling behind. I’ve taken 3 semesters of college and failed more than half of the classes I took. My classmates from highschool are finishing their second semester
    of their third year and have spent the last 3 and next couple years of their lives about their future career. I’ve accomplished a bit less in that particular category. But Web Development is my way back to being on track and I intend to make my 1
    year of learning for my first ‘real‘ job more valuable than 4 years of college could ever be.
  </p>
  <p>Reading a book a week is a big part of that. I was always a big reader but in the past few years I’ve stopped reading as much. This stopped when I read what is probably one of the first non-fiction books I’ve ever read. I had an epiphany. Two
    actually. The first was more about the book which was “Billionaire in training” by Brad Sugars which talks about how to become an entrepreneur. At one point Sugars talks about how entrepreneurs are usually good generalists. This minor sentence
    shook my world. I’ve always considered myself a jack of all trades but master of none, especially the last part. I could pick up things so quickly and everything would just click, but when it came to the advances knowledge that builds off the
    primary knowledge that I thought made sense to me I would always fail. Of course the failure was not because I was a generalist or master of none, but that's for another blog. But even if the logic was somewhat misguided this idea of being an
    entrepreneur due to me being a generalist put me on a path to become a web-developer and much more importantly it has allowed me to build a habit of constantly trying to better. The second epiphany was of course that I could gain all this
    knowledge and experience from people much better than me and use it to transform my life for the better.
  </p>
  <p>Which brings my to my ultimate goal of not just 2020 but for the rest of my life. Being happy. People familiar with SMART goal-making skills will realize that “I want to be happy” is a terrible goal. It is not specific, measurable, and
    unaccountable. And that is why it is actually just part of my happiness goal category. Here are the specific, measurable and accountable sub-goals for my ultimate goal of being happy with myself and my life.

    <li>
      The biggest counter to depression I’ve found is being productive. Of course, it is damn hard to be while depressed. Luckily, I’m in a much better state than I was and with proper habit-building and goal setting I am ready to finally ‘end’ my
      depression.
      <ul>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Meditate</li>
        <li>Writing blogs</li>
        <li>Learn Violin</li>
        <li>Keep up with chores and daily hygiene. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>By exercising. It’s not a resolution list without the exercise :)</li>
    <li>NoSurf. I never really had the problem of browsing social media and getting depressed seeing people’s best moments. The biggest problem for me is I just keep checking it and checking it and checking it throughout the day. I would open up
      Instagram ten times a day to look at the same post sitting at the top. I could wake up and just sit in bed for hours browsing reddit until I was finally hungry enough to actually start my day. I’ve already started dealing with this in December
      by deleting reddit and instagram off my phone. Unfortunately due to how ingrained snapchat is into my generation I can’t really delete it yet. I have made efforts to stop watching people’s stories as then I have no reason to open the app other
      than to see messages. It’s not like I wasn’t just tapping through all of them in milliseconds anyway.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Miscellaneous resolutions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Save 80% of income putting money into a Roth IRA, into my 401k, emergency, and other investment accounts. I am privileged to live with my parents so this should be attainable.
    </li>
    <li>Take Violin lessons. </li>
    <li>Learn Spanish with duolingo and practice with coworkers.</li>
    <li>Create and refine my memory palaces. This is not some Sherlock level stuff by the way. Anyone can do it. I’ll probably write a blog about it.</li>
    <li>Reflect on every day. Think about how to improve in every situation. Use the ABCDE Model, originally developed by Albert Ellis.
      <ul>
        <li>Activating Event</li>
        <li>Beliefs</li>
        <li>Consequences</li>
        <li>Dispute</li>
        <li>Effects</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Only pursue conflict when it violates your principles.</li>

  </ul>
